Updating and Preparing the VM: Ensuring the virtual machine (VM) has the latest system updates and essential tools like curl and git installed.

Installing Docker: Setting up Docker on Ubuntu by removing old versions, configuring the Docker repository, and installing Docker Engine to containerize applications.

Creating a Dockerfile for a Python ML App: Using a Dockerfile to define how the machine learning (ML) application will run, including installing necessary Python libraries and configuring the app.

Developing a Machine Learning Model: Building a simple decision tree classifier with the Iris dataset, training the model, and saving it as a .pkl file for later use in the Flask app.

Integrating the ML Model with a Flask API: Creating a Flask app that serves as an API, loading the trained model, and setting up endpoints for predictions.

Building and Running the Docker Container: Packaging the ML app into a Docker container and running it locally, making it accessible via a web browser or API call.

Version Control with Git and GitHub: Initializing a Git repository, committing the project files, and deploying the application to GitHub for version control and collaboration.
